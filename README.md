 Stack is implemented using an array. It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The operations include pushing a new value onto the stack, popping the top value from the stack, and displaying the current stack contents.
 
queue is also implemented using an array with front and rear pointers. It follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The available operations are enqueue, which adds a value to the rear of the queue; dequeue, which removes a value from the front; and display, which prints the queue from front to rear.

linked List is implemented using nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. The operations provided are inserting a new node at the end of the list, deleting a node from the beginning of the list, and displaying the contents of the list by traversing through all the nodes.

Circular linked List is similar to a normal linked list but with the last node pointing back to the first node. The operations include inserting a new node, deleting a specific node by its value, and displaying all nodes in a circular manner.
